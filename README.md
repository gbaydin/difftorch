## difftorch
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gbaydin/difftorch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gbaydin/difftorch)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/difftorch.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/difftorch)

difftorch is a functional differentiation API for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). The operations it implements mirror those available in [DiffSharp](https://github.com/DiffSharp/DiffSharp).


## Installation

### Install the latest package
To use the latest version available in [Python Package
Index](https://pypi.org/project/difftorch/), run:

```
pip install difftorch
```

### Install from source
To install from the source, clone this repository and install the difftorch package using:

```
git clone https://github.com/gbaydin/difftorch.git
cd difftorch
pip install .
```
## Examples
```python
import torch
import difftorch

def f_rosenbrock(x):
  x, y = x[0], x[1]
  return (1. - x)**2 + 100. * (y - x**2)**2

def f_spherical_cartesian(x):
    r, theta, phi = x[0], x[1], x[2]
    x, y, z = r*phi.sin()*theta.cos(), r*phi.sin()*theta.sin(), r*phi.cos()
    return torch.stack([x, y, z])
